# We'll adapt the bernoulli model we saw before into a binomial model
# - How would you change this model to use a binomial likelihood instead?
# - How would you make it possible to vary the parameters of the prior?
model {
  # Likelihood:
  for (i in 1:N) {
    y[i] ~ dbern(theta)
  }
  # Prior distribution:
  theta ~ dbeta(a, b)
  a <- 1
  b <- 1
